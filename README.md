- running main.py will show the distribution of particles as is given the advection diffusion eq with v = (sin(pi*y), 0), over the time interval [0, 1] with timesteps of dt = 1/10. 
- This is set to be on the Taurus [-1, 1] X [-1, 1] with nu as 0.000001, but this is all interchangable. 
- In the future want to make a heat map with colors that changes over time by particle concetration
- Also want to run tests for different nu 
- Uncommenting sections will show different visuals and allow to manipulate results
